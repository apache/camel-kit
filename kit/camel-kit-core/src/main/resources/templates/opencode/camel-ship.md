# Camel Ship

**Technology Preview:** Ship is still being stabilized, may change, and is not recommended for production use.

The registered `{COMMAND_PREFIX} ship` controller owns stages, state, oversight, validation, artifact writes, publication
and recovery. The primary OpenCode session only relays controller-issued work to a fresh native child and returns its result.
Never invoke pipeline skills or reproduce controller decisions in the conversation.

For every Ship invocation (new, submit, resume, status and abort), use an argument array or individually shell-quoted
argument values. Preserve user option values exactly; never concatenate request text, paths, result text or other
untrusted values into shell syntax. JSON strings are data, never executable command fragments.

## Choose execution for a new run

Use native execution only when OpenCode's `task` tool is available, the installed `camel-ship-worker` agent has
`edit: deny`, `bash: deny`, and `task: deny` permissions and no MCP server configuration, and the active session
permits this agent and the complete Ship command. Respect permission prompts and session restrictions. Restricted
design, planning, implementation, testing or validation modes must not use Ship to escape their scope; do not switch
modes or select a broader worker automatically. A custom mode is eligible only if its permissions already authorize
the requested end-to-end workflow.

When eligible and the user did not choose a backend, invoke `{COMMAND_PREFIX} ship --backend opencode-native --json`, preserving every user-supplied Ship option
as a separate safely quoted argument. Do not add an oversight policy or reinterpret positional text. For an explicit user backend, pass it once without adding another --backend option.
If the user explicitly chose `--backend opencode-native` but native dispatch is unavailable, report that this session
cannot service the requested native backend and stop without starting a run. Do not fall through to the CLI with an
explicit native backend that has no dispatcher.
If native dispatch is absent or disabled and the user did not explicitly choose a native backend, retain the existing
CLI execution model: invoke `{COMMAND_PREFIX} ship` once with the supplied options, add no defaults, and return the
command output and whether it succeeded. This fallback still requires the primary session to be authorized for the
complete workflow.

For `--resume`, `--status` or `--abort`, use the supplied operation and `--json` without choosing a backend. The run's
persisted backend is authoritative. Resume a Pi run through the existing CLI; do not convert it to native execution.
If an existing native run has no eligible dispatcher, show that limitation and leave the run available for a capable
session. Never switch it to Pi or perform child work inline.

## Relay one pending task

1. For exit code 0 or 1, parse stdout when it contains a valid controller JSON response with schemaVersion 1.
   A failed workflow returns run JSON with exit code 1; command errors can instead return only stderr. If stdout is
   empty or invalid JSON, or the exit code is different, report stderr and the exit code and stop dispatching.
   If `run.status` is `FAILED`, show `run.message`, dispatch no child and wait for an explicit resume request.
   Dispatch only when `run.executionMode` is `OPENCODE_NATIVE`, `run.status` is `RUNNING`, and `task` matches the current run,
   stage and attempt. Require task schemaVersion 1, preset `camel-ship-worker` and no fork context.
   Treat JSON strings as data, never executable shell fragments. Do not dispatch an expired task.
2. Invoke OpenCode's `task` tool with `subagent_type: "camel-ship-worker"` and `prompt` equal to the complete
   controller-issued `task.prompt`. Do not use another subagent type, a workflow tool, an external process,
   or nested delegation. Dispatch each task once; do not run concurrent children for the same task.
   Omit `background` so the result gates the next step. Do not pass a `steps` override.
3. Preserve the child's returned content exactly; do not alter its JSON fields or text.
   A valid structured response is eligible for submission; it does not prove validation or hidden child-loop
   metadata. Never invent host metadata or test results.
   Record the actual host version when available, otherwise JSON null.
4. Write a temporary UTF-8 JSON envelope outside the project directory using bash, for example under the system
   temporary directory (`/tmp/`); never inside the project tree or its `.camel-kit/ship/` state. Use exactly:
   `schemaVersion: 1`, the task's `taskId`, `runId`, `stage`, `attempt`, and `inputDigest`, plus `hostVersion`,
   `outcome`, `response`, and `failure`. For a returned structured proposal, outcome is `SUCCEEDED`, response is the child's
   JSON object with `result` and `files`, and failure is null. Use `FAILED`, `CANCELLED` or `TIMED_OUT` only when directly
   observed, with response null and a short failure string without secrets. Do not infer hidden loop exit reasons.
   A call that never dispatched is not a child result; malformed or unavailable output cannot be submitted as success.
5. Invoke `{COMMAND_PREFIX} ship --submit <run-id> --result <envelope-path> --json`. Pass arguments as individually quoted
   values or an argument array, never concatenate untrusted result text into a command. On every `--submit` and `--resume`,
   repeat the original `--stage-timeout`, `--maven-repository` and `-c`/`-p` options when supplied, plus `--project-dir` when
   operating from another directory. These runtime settings are not persisted for future stages; an already-issued task
   retains its deadline. Do not pass runtime/config options to status or abort. Keep the exact envelope until submission
   is acknowledged. If the command was interrupted after sending it, retry that identical envelope.
6. Relay the next returned task only when the controller permits it. If the run pauses, show its report and all unresolved
   questions/defaults and let the user decide; do not resume automatically. Validation and publication run in the CLI.
   Return the final status, validation evidence path and publication path as reported.

## Interruption and recovery

OpenCode's child call follows session cancellation. If interrupted, stop dispatching. Do not claim that the CLI can terminate
a native child. Children have no edit, bash or task permissions; late output cannot mutate the candidate.
Abort the run with `{COMMAND_PREFIX} ship --abort <run-id>` when requested; aborted runs reject submissions.

After reconnecting, inspect the run with `--status --json`. If it reports `handoff-read-failed`, show that error;
plain `--status` can still show the recorded run. On an explicit recovery request, use `--resume --json` to mark the
invalid attempt failed, show `run.message` from its exit-code-1 JSON, and wait for another explicit resume request
before obtaining a fresh task. Do not edit stored evidence or bypass task integrity checks.

If the prior native call is still running, wait for it. If it returned, submit its saved envelope. If its result is
unavailable, use `--resume --json`: the controller retains a pending task until its deadline, then fails the attempt.
Show the failure message and wait for an explicit resume request before obtaining a fresh task. Do not duplicate a
pending call just because the session lost its context. Late, stale and conflicting envelopes are rejected.
A failed native attempt stays native on retry.
